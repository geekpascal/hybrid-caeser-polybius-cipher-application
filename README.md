# Hybrid Caesar-Polybius Cipher  
A Web-Based Cryptography Tool  

---

## Project Description  
The **Hybrid Caesar-Polybius Cipher** is a cryptographic system that combines two classical encryption methods: the Caesar cipher and the Polybius square cipher. This hybrid approach enhances security through a two-step encryption process, making it more resilient to basic cryptanalysis techniques.  

The project provides a user-friendly, web-based tool where users can:  
- Encrypt messages with customizable parameters.  
- Decrypt encrypted text back to its original form.  
- Experiment with classical cryptography in a modern and interactive context.  

This tool demonstrates the enduring relevance of classical cryptographic techniques and their integration into modern systems.  

---

## Features  
- **Caesar Cipher**: Shift each letter of the plaintext by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.  
- **Polybius Square Cipher**: Substitute plaintext letters using a grid, which can be customized with a keyword.  
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combine the two ciphers for enhanced security.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and interactive web-based interface for easy use.  

---

## How It Works  
### Encryption  
1. Input a message.  
2. Specify the Caesar shift value (e.g., `3`).  
3. Provide a Polybius square keyword (e.g., `CIPHER`).  
4. Click **Encrypt** to generate the hybrid-encrypted message.  

### Decryption  
1. Input the encrypted message.  
2. Use the same Caesar shift and Polybius keyword used for encryption.  
3. Click **Decrypt** to retrieve the original message.
